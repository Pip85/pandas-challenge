PyCity Schools Project

This project required merging two data files of metrics on a school district, cleaning and organizing data into tables
for data analysis on school performance.
Metrics include school size, spending, type of school (district or charter) and performance in math, reading & both.

The first table provides a summary shot of performance in reading, math and overall in the district as a whole.
The second table provides a more detailed look at performance in those same categories at the individual school level.
The following two tables look at the top and bottom performers indicating the better performance in charter type schools.
Tables 5 & 6 examine performance by school across each grade (9th through 12th).
The final three tables examine performance based on school spending per student, school size and type.
